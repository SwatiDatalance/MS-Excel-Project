*Pivot Tables in Excel*

Sales1.csv

1) Great tool for creating quick summary totals based on a list of data.
2) Tables that anybody could look at and understands. We can group data together, show some information at broad larger scale.
3) List should have no empty rows/columns.
4) If we do make changes to the source data, the pivot table does not adjust automatically. To refresh data in pivot table:
    Use alt+F5 or Go to Analyze tab ---> Refresh data.
